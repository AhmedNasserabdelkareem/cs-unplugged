Changelog
##############################################################################

This page lists updates to CS Unplugged.
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

We base our numbering system from the guidelines at `Semantic Versioning 2.0.0`_,
however since our project started before it was migrated to GitHub, the first
major open source release is being labeled as ``2.0.0``.

Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.HOTFIX:

- MAJOR version change when major text modifications are made (for example: new
  topic).
- MINOR version change when content or functionality is added or updated (for
  example: new videos, new activities, large number of text (typo/grammar) fixes).
- HOTFIX version change when bug hotfixes are made (for example: fixing a typo).
- A pre-release version is denoted by appending a hyphen and the alpha label
  followed by the pre-release version.

We have listed major changes for each release below.

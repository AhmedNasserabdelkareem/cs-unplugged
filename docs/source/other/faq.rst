What is a URL slug?
==============================================================================

A URL slug is a short label for something, containing only letters, numbers,

In our system, a slug must be no longer than 50 characters, and use hyphens
instead of underscores.

These are *valid* example slugs:

- ``algorithms``
- ``binary-numbers``
- ``exercise-2``

These are *invalid* example slugs:

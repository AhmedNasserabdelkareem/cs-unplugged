- Use the `SET` block to set the value of your new variables.
  In this challenge call your variable `number of dots` and set it to `answer`.
  Use the subtract operation under `Operators` script to subtract from the value of your variable.
  Use the `JOIN` block under `Operators` script to combine two strings.
- The IF block checks if the condition is true and then runs the blocks inside of the IF block.
  In this challenge you need to use IF statements to check if the `number of dots` is greater than or equal to 16 (use the OR block under `Operators` scripts).
  If it is, display card “16” and subtract 16 from your number and do the same with the rest of the cards.
- You can also use the `IF/ELSE` block if you need to run a set of blocks if the condition is not true.
  In the extra challenge you need to ask the user to enter a number less than or equal to 31 if the input which was entered was greater than 31.
- Test your program with some values on the boundaries (i.e. 32, 31, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1)

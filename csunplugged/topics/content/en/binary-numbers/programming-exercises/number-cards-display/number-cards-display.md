# Number of cards to display

## Objective

- Explain what you need to consider if you are asking for input from the end user.
- Describe how variables store values and how they are used in this program.
- Identify when to use a loop to repeat a set of instructions.

## Requirement

Write a program to display numbers 1, 2, 4, 8,... for a given number of cards as the input. 

Make a variable called `number of cards` to store the number of cards to display entered by the end user as the input (e.g. 5) and a variable called `number of dots` to store the number of dots (e.g. 1, 2, 4, 8, 16) where each number is calculated by multiplying the previous number by 2.

## Input

5 number of cards to display

## Output

When the check mark button is clicked or Enter key is pressed you should see the number of dots on each card, which would give the following output if the input is 5.

## Extra challenge:

Display the numbers from largest to smallest (display numbers 16, 8, 4, 2 and 1).

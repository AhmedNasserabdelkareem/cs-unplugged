# Counting 5 black and white cards as one input (without a loop)

## Objective

- Explain what you need to consider if you are asking for input from the end user.
- Describe how variables store values and how they are used in this program.
- Identify when to use an if statement to check a set of conditions.
- Prove how indexing to access a letter at the specified position in a string works.

## Requirement

Write a program which asks the end user to enter 5 black and white cards representing bits, all as one input ('B' for black and 'W' for white), and displays the total number of dots as the output.

Make a variable called `total number of dots` and set its value to 0.
Make a string variable called `cards` and set its value to the input entered by the end user (5 black and white cards).
Check each letter of the string and if it’s ‘W’ add the corresponding number of dots (16 for the first letter, 8 for the second letter and so on) to the `total number of dots`.
Display the `total number of dots` as the output.

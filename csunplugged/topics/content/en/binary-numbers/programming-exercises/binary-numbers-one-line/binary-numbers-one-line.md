# Display Binary Numbers In One Line

## Objective:

- Describe how variables store values and how they are used in this program.
- Identify when to use a loop to repeat a set of instructions.
- Explain why a join block is required to combine strings.

## Requirement:

Write a program to display numbers 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16 on the screen, all in one line. 

Make variables called:

- `number of dots` to store the number of dots 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 where each number is calculated by multiplying the previous number by 2.
- `binary cards` to store a set of strings “1, 2, 4, 8, 16,” and displays it as the output. 

## Input:

None

## Extra challenge:

Now try removing the last `,` from the end of your output.

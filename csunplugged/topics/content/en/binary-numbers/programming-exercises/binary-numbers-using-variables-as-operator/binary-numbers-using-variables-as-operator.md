# Display Binary Numbers (using variables as an operator)

## Objective:

- Explain why programming has to have exact sequencing of code.
- Outline how storing values in a variable is updated because of what you coded.

## Requirement:

Write a program to display numbers 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16 on the screen one at a time for 1 second each.

Make a variable called `number of dots` and change its value by using an operator (multiplying it by 2 before displaying it on the screen each time). Notice in this program as you are multiplying the variable `number of dots` by 2 this variable has been assigned to a number.

## Input:

None

# Cards to display for a given number 

## Objective

- Explain what you need to consider if you are asking for input from the end user.
- Describe how variables store values and how they are used in this program.
- Identify when to use an if statement to check a set of conditions.

## Requirement

Write a program which asks the user to enter a number of dots less than or equal to 31 as the input and displays which of the 5 cards should be showing as the output (one at a time for 1 second each). 

Make a variable called “number of dots” and set its value to the input entered by the end user.
Below is the algorithm to help you program this;

If “number of dots” less than or equal to 31
	If “number of dots” greater than or equal to 16
		Subtract 16 from “number of dots” and display “16”
	If “number of dots” greater than or equal to 8
		Subtract 8 from “number of dots” and display “8”
	If “number of dots” greater than or equal to 4
		Subtract 4 from “number of dots” and display “4”
	If “number of dots” greater than or equal to 2
		Subtract 2 from “number of dots” and display “2”
	If “number of dots” greater than or equal to 1
		Subtract 1 from “number of dots” and display “1”
else
	Ask the end user to enter a number less than or equal to “31”

Example:

## Input

11 

## Output

When the check mark button is clicked or Enter key is pressed you should see the following output:

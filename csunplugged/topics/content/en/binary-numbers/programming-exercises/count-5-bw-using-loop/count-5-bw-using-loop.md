# Counting 5 black and white cards (using a loop)

## Objective

- Explain what you need to consider if you are asking for input from the end user.
- Describe how variables store values and how they are used in this program.
- Identify when to use an if statement to check a set of conditions.
- Identify when to use a loop to repeat a set of instructions.

## Requirement

Write a program that asks the end user to enter 5 black and white cards representing bits ('B' for black and 'W' for white which are entered one at a time) and displays the total number of dots as the output.
Use a loop for this challenge.

Make a variable called `total number of dots` and set its value to 0.
Make another variable called “number of dots” and set its value to 16.
Add the value of `number of dots` to the value of `total number of dots` every time the end user enters ‘W’ as the input.
Repeat this 5 times dividing the value of `number of dots` by 2 each time.
Display the `total number of dots` as the output.

## Input

BWWBW

## Output

13

When the last check mark button is clicked or Enter key is pressed you should see the following output:

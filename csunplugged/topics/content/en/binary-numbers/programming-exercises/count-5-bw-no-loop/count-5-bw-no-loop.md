# Counting 5 black and white cards (without a loop)

## Objective

- Explain what you need to consider if you are asking for input from the end user.
- Describe how variables store values and how they are used in this program.
- Identify when to use an if statement to check a set of conditions.

## Requirement

Write a program that asks the user to enter 5 black and white cards representing bits ('B' for black and 'W' for white which are entered one at a time) and displays the total number of dots as the output.

Make a variable called `total number of dots` and set it to 0.
Add the corresponding number of dots (16 for the first input, 8 for the second input and so on) to the `total number of dots` every time the end user enters ‘W’ as the input.
You would need to use 5 IF blocks for this challenge.

## Input

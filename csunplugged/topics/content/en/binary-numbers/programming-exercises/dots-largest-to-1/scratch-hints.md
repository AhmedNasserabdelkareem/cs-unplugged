- You can ask a question by using the `ASK` block.
  Replace the text “What’s your name?” with your own question.
  The user input will be stored in a predefined variable called `answer` after the check mark button is clicked or Enter key is pressed.
  You can view the value of `answer` by clicking the checkbox next to the answer block.
- You can find `make a new variable` under `data` script to create a new variable. Make sure your variable name is as descriptive as possible.
- Use the `SET` block to set the value of your new variable. Use the divide operation under `Operators` script to divide the value of your variable by 2. 
- Display the value of your variable on the screen by replacing `Hello` in your `SAY` block with your new variable. 
- Use the `REPEAT UNTIL` block to run the blocks inside while the condition is true. In this challenge you need to repeat the blocks until number of dots is equal to 1.

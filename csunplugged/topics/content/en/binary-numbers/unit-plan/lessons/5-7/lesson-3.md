# Codes for Letters Using Binary Representation

## Duration

45 minutes

## Resources
- 1 set of 8 binary cards with 1 to 128 dots on them
- 1 set per pair of students of 4 binary cards with 1 to 16 dots on them

## Key Questions

How many different characters can you type on a computer?
(Discussion may start at the 26 letters of the English alphabet, and then expand to other characters on the keyboard, including capital letters, digits and punctuation. Students may be aware that other languages can have thousands of characters, and the range of characters is also expanding as emoticons are invented!)

## Lesson Starter

Discuss how you would communicate a letter of the alphabet to someone if all you could do is say a number between 0 and 26.
(Students will usually suggest using a code of 1 or a, 2 for b, and so on)

Work out and write down the binary numbers using 5 bits from 0 to 26 on the worksheet.

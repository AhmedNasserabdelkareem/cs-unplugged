# How Binary Digits Work

**Note from the developers:**
We’ve noticed that once students understand how the binary number system works, they have many questions and are excited to explore the concepts outlined in this lesson further. We’ve added a lot of information into this lesson, however, it is not our intention that you will teach and cover all the concepts, but that you have at your fingertips the information you need when your students express an interest in learning more.

## Duration

45 minutes

## Resources

- 1 set of large binary cards from 1 to 128 dots (8 cards)
- 1 set per pair of students of student binary cards from 1 to 16 dots (5 cards)

## Key Questions

- What different number systems do we know about?
- Why do we use 10 digits? What if we counted in 8s? How would we do that?

### Potential answers could include

- Roman Numerals
- Tally marks
- Number bases like binary, octal and hexadecimal
- Language based systems like Chinese or Ancient Egyptian

## Key Questions

- What is the binary number system?

## Lesson Starter

1. Hold the first 5 cards (1, 2, 4, 8 and 16 dots), but don't let students see the dots. Ask for 5 students to volunteer to be “bits”, and have them stand in a line in front of the class.
2. Hand out the 1-dot card to the person on the right. Explain that they are one "bit" (binary digit), and can be on or off, black or white, 0 or 1 dots. The only rule is that their card is either completely visible, or not visible (i.e. flipped over). Hand out the second card so that the first card is on the far right. Point out that this card has either 2 dots, or none.
3. Ask the class what the number of dots on the next card will be. Get them to explain why they think that.

**Teaching Observations**

Students will usually suggest it should be three. If they suggest 4, they have probably done the activity before (or have seen the cards you are holding!) If they suggest the wrong number, don't correct them, but continue without comment, so that they can construct the rule for themselves.

4. Silently give out the four-dot card, and let them try to see the pattern.

**Teaching Observations**

Usually some students will complain that you've missed out the three, but simply indicate that you haven't made a mistake. This gives them the opportunity to try to construct the pattern for themselves.

5. Ask what the next card is, and why.

**Teaching Observations**

At this point it is common for students to guess that it is 6 (since it follow the numbers 2 and 4). However, if you let them think about it a little more, some will usually come up with 8, and those students should be able to convince the others that they are correct (there are several ways a student could explain this e.g. that each card is double the previous one, or that if you take two of a card, you get the next one)

6. Students should be able to work out the fifth card (16 dots) without help:
7. How many dots would the next card have if we carried on to the left? (32) The next...? (There's no need to have students hold these cards, as they won't be used in the next part of the activity).
8. Continue with 64 and 128 dots.

**Teaching Observations**

At 128 dots there would be 8 cards. This is 8 bits, which is commonly referred to as a byte. It may be distracting to bring this up at this point, but some students may already be familiar with the idea that 8 bits is a byte, and make that observation. However, in the meantime, we'll work with a 5-bit representation, which isn't as useful as a whole byte, but a good size for teaching.

A common mistake is to hand out the cards from left to right, but it's convention in number representation that the least significant value is on the right, and this is an important idea for students to take away from this activity.

# How Binary Digits Work


##Note from the developers: 

We’ve noticed that once students understand how the binary number system works, they have many questions and are excited to explore the concepts outlined in this lesson further. We’ve added a lot of information into this lesson, however, it is not our intention that you will teach and cover all the concepts, but that you have at your fingertips the information you need when your students express an interest in learning more.

## Duration

45 minutes

## Learning Outcomes

Students will be able to:

**Computational Thinking:**  
- Explain how a binary digit is represented using two contrasting values.
- Demonstrate how to represent any number between 0 and 63 using just two digits. (For younger students, this might be limited to 0 to 31).
- Perform a demonstration of how the binary number system works by converting any decimal number into a binary number.
- Justify why there aren’t actual 0’s and 1’s zooming around inside a computer.
- Argue that 0’s and 1’s are still a correct way to represent what is stored in the computer.
- Generalise by recognising that we can use any two different states or things to represent binary; it doesn’t have to just be 0’s and 1’s 
- Explain the logic of why the right-hand bit needs to represent a one. 
- Understand that we only need two different digits to represent any number and using more isn’t needed.
- Explain why a particular card (bit) must be visible or not for a given number 
- Use logical reasoning to predict what value the next card (bit) in the left-to-right sequence will have (e.g. the last one is 32, what is the next one? 64. The next one? 128. Next? 256…)
- Explain why we only need one more bit to represent twice as many numbers.

**Curriculum Integration:**  
- Identify that mistakes lead to new learning.
- Mathematics: adding numbers up to 63 (or 31), comparing numbers, odd/even numbers, sequence, doubling, digits, place value
- English: Giving instructions

## CSUnplugged Provided Resources

- 1 set of large [binary cards](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8fch8xEe3IgX21XUTh0TnZKblk/view?usp=sharing) from 1 to 128 dots (8 cards)
- 1 set per pair of students of [student binary cards](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B8fch8xEe3IgSG5wYU1BWlYxejg) from 1 to 32 dots (6 cards)

There is also an online interactive version of the binary cards [here](http://www.csfieldguide.org.nz/en/interactives/binary-cards/index.html?digits=8), from the [Computer Science Field Guide](http://www.csfieldguide.org.nz/), but it is preferable to work with physical cards.

## Classroom Resources

- Pencils and paper or whiteboard and whiteboard pens

## Key Questions

- What different number systems do we know about? (Answers might include: Roman Numerals; Tally marks; Number bases like binary, octal and hexadecimal; Language based systems like Chinese or Ancient Egyptian.)
- Why do we normally use 10 digits? (Probably because we have 10 fingers, plus it's a fairly efficient way to write things compared with, say, tally marks.)
- Why do we have different number systems? (They are convenient for different things e.g. tally marks are easy if you are counting; Roman numerals can be useful for making a number look more mysterious or harder to read)

# Lesson Starter
1. Hold the first 5 cards (1, 2, 4, 8 and 16 dots), but don't let students see the dots. Ask for 5 students to volunteer to be “bits”, and have them stand in a line in front of the class.
2. Hand out the 1-dot card to the person on the right. Explain that they are one "bit" (binary digit), and can be on or off, black or white, 0 or 1 dots. The only rule is that their card is either completely visible, or not visible (i.e. flipped over). Hand out the second card to the second person from the right. Point out that this card has either 2 dots (visible), or none (upside down). 
3. Ask the class what the number of dots on the next card will be. Get them to explain why they think that.

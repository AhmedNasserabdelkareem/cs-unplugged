# How Binary Digits Work


##Note from the developers: 

We’ve noticed that once students understand how the binary number system works, they have many questions and are excited to explore the concepts outlined in this lesson further. We’ve added a lot of information into this lesson, however, it is not our intention that you will teach and cover all the concepts, but that you have at your fingertips the information you need when your students express an interest in learning more.

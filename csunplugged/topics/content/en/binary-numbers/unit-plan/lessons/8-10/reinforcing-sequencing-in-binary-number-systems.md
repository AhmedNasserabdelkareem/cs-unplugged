# Reinforcing Sequencing In Binary Number Systems

##  Learning Outcomes

#### Computational Thinking:

- Explain how a binary digit is represented using two contrasting values.
- Demonstrate how to represent any number between 0 and 63 using just two digits. (For younger students, this might be limited to 0 to 31).
- Perform a demonstration of how the binary number system works by converting any decimal number into a binary number.
- Justify why there aren’t actual 0’s and 1’s zooming around inside a computer.
- Argue that 0’s and 1’s are still a correct way to represent what is stored in the computer.
- Generalise by recognising that we can use any two different states or things to represent binary; it doesn’t have to just be 0’s and 1’s
- Explain the logic of why the right-hand bit needs to represent a one.
- Understand that we only need two different digits to represent any number and using more isn’t needed.
- Explain why a particular card (bit) must be visible or not for a given number
- Use logical reasoning to predict what value the next card (bit) in the left-to-right sequence will have (e.g. the last one is 32, what is the next one? 64. The next one? 128. Next? 256…)
- Explain why we only need one more bit to represent twice as many numbers.

#### Curriculum Integration:

- Mathematics: adding numbers up to 63 (or 31), comparing numbers, odd/even numbers, sequence, doubling, digits, place value
- English: Giving instructions, explaining an idea through a presentation
- Media: video planning, production and editing


## CSUnplugged Provided Resources

- [1 set of large binary cards from 1 to 128 dots (8 cards)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-SN1PgPBbCYV0ZQc3VmaEs4ZXM/view?usp=sharing)
- [1 set per pair of students of student binary cards from 1 to 32 dots (6 cards)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-SN1PgPBbCYQW1xcmVkekg2S1k/view?usp=sharing)

There is also an online interactive version of the binary cards [here](http://www.csfieldguide.org.nz/en/interactives/binary-cards/index.html?digits=8), from the [Computer Science Field Guide](http://www.csfieldguide.org.nz/), but it is preferable to work with physical cards.

## Classroom Resources

The following items are highly motivating, however you can use any resources you have available in your classroom that have two different states or sizes.

- Playdough/plasticine
- Musical instruments
- Mathematics equipment such as mini teddy bears
- Glue a stick onto paper plates and have one side on and the other side off

## Key Question

- How can you create a 60 second or less video to teach someone how binary works without using the binary cards?

## Lesson Starter

Teacher says to class: “We are going to create a video that shows binary numbers in use.”

## Lesson Activities

In this lesson students will make a video that gives instructions on how to represent any given number in binary. The video must include a demonstration of one of the following:
  - How to count from 0 to 8 or more using binary numbers.
  - How you would work out the number 22.
Brainstorm together items you could use to make this video with. It should be different to how it has been demonstrated to the class, so they are not allowed to just video cards with dots on them (but they may want to use them to help with their planning).

Within the hour students will have taken the raw footage needed to make the movie and imported it into a simple movie format using available software like iMovie or StopMotion.

Early finishers can edit their work, add music and then be camera crew for others.

Tips to before sending off for the 60 minute challenge:

1. The order of place values in a binary number is the same as the conventional (decimal) place value system, so the highest is on the left, smallest value on the right.

2. Make sure that if you are using colours or other representations there is a strong contrast.


{panel type="general" title="Teaching Observations"}

1. The number pattern is from highest to lowest, left to right (it's just a convention, but we use the same one in decimal, with the most significant digits on the left):
  16, 8, 4, 2, 1
  Therefore watch that they aren’t representing 1 as:
  1, 0, 0, 0, 0 (which actually represents the decimal number 16)

2. Below is an example of where students believed that 3 in decimal is represented as 00100, as they focused on the pattern of numbers rather than using the place values.
  00001
  00010
  00100 (where it should be 00011 for 3)

3. The videos below were made within 60 minutes, to provide you with realistic videos that your students can expand on. Like all completed work, there is always something you can improve on.
  It's very hard to get every detail exactly right when you are explaining things, so the important thing is that students are demonstrating that they have the big concepts, rather than getting every detail right; minor errors such as an incorrect number can be discussion points for other students.

## Applying What We Have Just Learnt

Review each other’s videos

1. Can you recognise any misconceptions about the binary number system that have appeared in a video?

2. What made the videos interesting or appealing that another person might be able to learn from them?

## Lesson Reflection

- How can you use these videos to support others to learn about the binary number system?
- What were the key points that are now clear about the binary number system now that you’ve created your video?
- What questions do you have after making this video in relation to the binary number system?
  (Typically responses are that they want to understand further how binary numbers are used to show letters, images, videos and all things on a computer - these topics are covered in further lesson plans)

## Computational Thinking Links

This lesson supports students to apply and recognise the computational thinking links from lesson one.

Explicit links could include:

{panel type="ct-algorithm" title="Algorithmic thinking"}

#### What to look for:
Do students demonstrate how the binary number system works by explaining, systematically, what is happening to work out the binary representation of a given number?

{panel end}

{panel type="ct-abstraction" title="Abstraction"}

#### What to look for:
Ask students to look at a video created and  list the features of the objects used that are important to demonstrate the binary number system and those that aren’t relevant at all. e.g. using Maths teddy bears - having the back or front showing is important, the colour of the teddy isn’t important, the size of the teddy isn’t important.

{panel end}

{panel type="ct-decomposition" title="Decomposition"}

#### What to look for:
Watch a video and ask students to point out one element in it that is decomposition e.g.  this could be when a single bit out of a group is determined to be on or off.

{panel end}

{panel type="ct-pattern" title="Generalising and patterns"}

#### What to look for:
Have students review three videos and ask what do these videos have in common and what is different about them.

{panel end}

{panel type="ct-logic" title="Logic"}

#### What to look for:
Finding errors or misconceptions in the videos may exercise some logical reasoning.

{panel end}

{panel type="ct-evaluation" title="Evaluation"}

#### What to look for:
Have students consider the number of bits used in each demonstration, and the difference this makes in the range of values that can be represented.

{panel end}

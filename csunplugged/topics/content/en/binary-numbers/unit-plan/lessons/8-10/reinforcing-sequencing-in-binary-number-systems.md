# Reinforcing Sequencing In Binary Number Systems


## Duration

60 minutes

## Learning Outcomes

**Computational thinking:**  
 - As for lesson 1

**Curriculum Integration:**  
  - Mathematics: adding numbers up to 63 (or 31), comparing numbers, odd/even numbers, sequence, doubling, digits, place value
  - English: Giving instructions, explaining an idea through a presentation
  - Media: video planning, production and editing

## CSUnplugged Provided Resources

- [1 set of large binary cards from 1 to 128 dots (8 cards)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-SN1PgPBbCYV0ZQc3VmaEs4ZXM/view?usp=sharing)
- [1 set per pair of students of student binary cards from 1 to 32 dots (6 cards)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-SN1PgPBbCYQW1xcmVkekg2S1k/view?usp=sharing)

There is also an online interactive version of the binary cards [here](http://www.csfieldguide.org.nz/en/interactives/binary-cards/index.html?digits=8), from the [Computer Science Field Guide](http://www.csfieldguide.org.nz/).

## Classroom Resources

The following items are highly motivating, however you can use any resources you have available in your classroom that have two different states or sizes.  
  - Playdough/plasticine
  - Musical instruments
  - Mathematics equipment such as mini teddy bears 
  - Glue a stick onto paper plates and have one side on and the other side off 

## Key Question

How can you create a 60 second or less video to teach someone how binary works without using the binary cards? 

## Lesson Starter

Teacher says to class: “We are going to create a video that shows binary numbers in use.”

## Lesson Activities

In this lesson students will make a video that gives instructions on how to represent any given number in binary. The video must include a demonstration of one of the following:  
  - How to count from 0 to 8 or more using binary numbers.
  - How you would work out the number 22.

Brainstorm together items you could use to make this video with. It should be different to how it has been demonstrated to the class, so they are not allowed to just video cards with dots on them (but they may want to use them to help with their planning). 

Within the hour students will have taken the raw footage needed to make the movie and imported it into a simple movie format using available software like iMovie or StopMotion.

Early finishers can edit their work, add music and then be camera crew for others. 

Tips to before sending off for the 60 minute challenge:  
  1. The order of place values in a binary number is the same as the conventional (decimal) place value system, so the highest is on the left, smallest value on the right. 
  2. Make sure that if you are using colours or other representations there is a strong contrast.

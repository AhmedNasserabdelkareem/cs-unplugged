# Reinforcing Sequencing in Binary Number Systems

## Duration

60 minutes

## Resources

The following items are highly motivating, however please use any resources you have available in your classroom that have two different states or sizes.

- Playdough/plasticine
- Musical instruments
- Mathematics equipment such as mini teddy bears
- Glue a stick onto paper plates and have one side on and the other side off

## Key Questions

- How can you create a 60 second or less video to teach someone how binary works without using the binary cards?

## Lesson Starter

Teacher says to class: “We are going to create a video that shows binary numbers in use.”

## Lesson Activities

Brainstorm together items you could use to make this video with. It should be different to how it has been demonstrated to the class, so they are not allowed to use cards with dots on them.

Within the hour students will have taken the raw footage needed to make the movie and imported it into a simple movie format using available software like iMovie or StopMotion.

Early finishers can edit their work, add music and then be camera crew for others.

Tips to before sending off for the 60 minute challenge:

1. The order of place values in a binary number is the same as the conventional (decimal) place value system, so the highest is on the left, smallest value on the right.
2. Make sure that if you are using colours there is a strong contrast.

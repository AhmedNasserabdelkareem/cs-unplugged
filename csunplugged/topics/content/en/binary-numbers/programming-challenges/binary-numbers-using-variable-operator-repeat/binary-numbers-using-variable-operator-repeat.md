# Display Binary Numbers (using a variable, operator and a repeat loop)

## Objective:

- Outline how storing values in a variable is updated because of what you coded.
- Describe how a variable can be displayed as an output.
- Identify when to use a loop to repeat a set of instructions.

## Requirement:

Write a program to display numbers 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16 on the screen one at a time for 1 second each using a variable called `number of dots`.

Use a loop to repeat a set of blocks to change the value of variable `number of dots` (by multiplying it by 2) and displaying it on the screen each time.

## Input:

# Display number of dots left to right with a given largest card

## Objective

- Explain what you need to consider if you are asking for input from the end user.
- Describe how variables store values and how they are used in this program.
- Identify when to use a loop to repeat a set of instructions.
- Explain why a join block is required to combine strings.

## Requirement

Write a program which takes the largest number of dots on a card as an input and displays the bit values from largest to smallest all in one line as the output.

Make a variable called “number of dots” and set it to the largest number of dots entered as the input. Repeat dividing the value of “number of dots” by 2 and add the result each time to a string variable called “binary cards” until “number of dots” is equal to 1. Display the value of “binary cards” as the output.

# Count dots on 5 black and white cards as one input (using a loop)

## Requirement:

Write a program that asks the end user to enter 5 black and white cards
representing bits, all as one input ('B' for black and 'W' for white), and
displays the total number of dots as the output.
Use a loop for this challenge, so it could be changed to work for a different
number of cards.

## Testing examples:

Your program should display the outputs shown in this table for the given
inputs provided:

| Input                 | Output |
|-----------------------|--------|
| B<br>B<br>B<br>B<br>W | 1      |
| B<br>B<br>B<br>B<br>B | 0      |
| W<br>W<br>W<br>W<br>W | 31     |

-   To make a new list click on "Make a list" button in the "Data" section.
    Here is two of several possible ways to add items to your list:

    -   Use `scratch:add [thing] to [planets v]` which adds items to the end of your list.
        Before adding new items to your list make sure you clear the old items from the list.
        You can do this by using `scratch:delete (all v) of [planets v]` at the start of your program.

    -   Click on the "+" sign on the left bottom corner of your list on the stage.
        Add your first item and press return to add another item.
        To add items this way you have to make sure your list is shown on the stage (click the checkbox next to the block to show the list on the stage).
        You can remove an individual item from your list by clicking on the item and pressing the 'x' on the right hand side.

-   To report the item at the specified position in the list use the `scratch:item () of [planets v] :: list`.
    You can specify which item to report by choosing from the pull-down menu or typing in a number.
    Choosing "random" reports a random item in the list.

# Search for an item within a list (using a loop)

## Requirement:

Write a program that adds 8 planets ("Mercury", "Venus", "Earth", "Mars", "Jupiter", "Saturn", "Uranus" and "Neptune") to a list called "planets".
It then asks the user to enter a name of a planet as the input and checks every item of the list, one by one, to see if it’s on the list.
If it is, displays a message that what was entered is a planet with its index position in the list and keeps searching through the rest of the list.
You need to use a loop for this challenge (this is like a sequential search, except to keep the program simple it keeps searching even after it finds the value).

## Testing examples:

Your program should display the outputs shown in this table for the given inputs provided.

| Input  | Output                                                                    |
|--------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Saturn | Saturn is a planet and it was found at the index 6 of the “planets” list. |
| Venus  | Venus is a planet and it was found at the index 2 of the “planets” list.  |

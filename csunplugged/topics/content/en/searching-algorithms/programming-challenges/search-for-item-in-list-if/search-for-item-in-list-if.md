# Search for an item within a list (using 8 "if" blocks)

## Requirement:

Write a program that adds 8 planets ("Mercury", "Venus", "Earth", "Mars", "Jupiter", "Saturn", "Uranus" and "Neptune") to a list called "planets".
It then asks the user to enter a name of a planet as the input and checks every item of the list, one by one, to see if itâ€™s on the list.
If it is, displays a message that what was entered is a planet with its index position in the list.
You need to use 8 conditional for this challenge (this challenge avoids having to use a loop).

## Testing examples:

Your program should display the outputs shown in this table for the given inputs provided.

| Input   | Output                                                                     |
|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Mars    | Mars is a planet and it was found at the index 4 of the "planets" list.    |
| Mercury | Mercury is a planet and it was found at the index 1 of the "planets" list. |

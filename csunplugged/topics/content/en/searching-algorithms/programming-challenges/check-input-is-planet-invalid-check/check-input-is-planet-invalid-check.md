# Check if input is a planet and display a message if itâ€™s not a planet

## Requirement:

Write a program that displays: "There are 8 planets in the Solar System: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune".
It then asks the user to enter a name of a planet.
If the answer is one of the eight planets in the Solar System, it tells the user their answer is correct.
It then checks if anything other than the 8 planets has been entered as the input and if so, display an output which would say what was entered is not a planet.

## Testing examples:

Your program should display the outputs shown in this table for the given inputs provided.

| Input   | Output                                |
|---------|---------------------------------------|
| Mercury | You are correct! Mercury is a planet. |
| Moon    | Moon is not a planet!                 |

# This file stores data for Classic CS Unplugged, used for redirections
# and searching.

# Text values are stored within this file (and not separate language
# files) as the names are only used within the search application
# for the English language. This is because the Classic CS Unplugged
# website can only guarantee English content.

# Each slug is used for URL matching, with the following values:
# 1. name: Name of page, used for backend and search results.
# 2. indexed: If 'false' given, the page will not be indexed for searching.
# 3. redirect (optional - default is redirect to classic subdomain): Allows
#    setting redirection method. If an explicit link is given (starts with
#    http), then this is used. If a string is given, then this is used with
#    Django URL routing.

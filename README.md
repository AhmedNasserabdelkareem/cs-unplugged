# Computer Science Unplugged

CS Unplugged is a collection of free learning activities that teach Computer Science through engaging games and puzzles that use cards, string, crayons and lots of running around.
The activities introduce students to Computational Thinking through concepts such as binary numbers, algorithms and data compression, separated from the distractions and technical details of having to use computers.
Importantly, no programming is required to engage with these ideas!

Current CS Unplugged material can be viewed at [csunplugged.org](http://csunplugged.org/).

## Repository Status

We are currently developing new CS Unplugged material, and later a website system will be developed for delivering this content.

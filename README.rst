Computer Science Unplugged is a collection of free learning activities that
teach Computer Science through engaging games and puzzles that use cards,
string, crayons and lots of running around.
The activities introduce students to Computational Thinking through concepts
such as binary numbers, algorithms and data compression, separated from the
distractions and technical details of having to use computers.
